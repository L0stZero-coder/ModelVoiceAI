# ModelVoiceAI
ModelVoiceAI is a C# .NET 6.0 console application that empowers a virtual AI persona (referred to as Model) to express human-like emotions using Azure Text-to-Speech (TTS). This project combines voice synthesis, emotional inference from contextual memory, and permission-based control to create emotionally expressive AI speech.
